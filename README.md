# Football Match Simulator

## Overview

The Football Match Simulator is a web application that simulates a football (soccer) match between two user-defined teams. It provides a real-time updating display of match statistics, a chronological timeline of events, and a final match result including the winner. The application aims to provide an engaging and realistic simulation experience with intuitive user interaction.

## Features

- **Team Customization:** Allows users to input and change the names of Team A and Team B before the match begins, promoting user engagement and personalization.
- **Real-Time Match Simulation:** Simulates a football match with a dynamic timeline, updating the score, match time (in minutes), and key statistics in real-time.
- **Comprehensive Statistics:** Displays comprehensive statistics during the simulation, including goals, shots on target, corners, penalties, red cards, and yellow cards, providing a detailed overview of the match progression.
- **Match Timeline:** A chronological timeline displays key events like goals, cards, and substitutions as they occur during the simulated match, offering a narrative of the game.
- **Final Result Display:** Clearly displays the final match result, including the score and the winning team (or a draw), ensuring clarity and completeness.
- **Restart Functionality:** Provides a 'Restart' button that initiates a new match with reset statistics and timeline, allowing for multiple simulations.
- **Intuitive User Interface:** Designed with a user-friendly interface that is responsive and easy to navigate, ensuring a positive user experience. The visual design includes a green, pitch-themed background.
- **Clearly Labeled Elements:** All interactive elements, such as buttons and input fields, are clearly labeled to guide users through the application.

## Technical Stack

- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Libraries:
    - None - application uses vanilla JavaScript
- Data: None - the simulation is self-contained and does not require external data sources.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Internet connection

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository: `git clone [repository URL]`
2.  Navigate to the project directory: `cd [project directory]`
3.  Open `index.html` in a web browser

No build process or dependencies are needed, as the application is a pure client-side implementation using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Usage

### How to Use

1.  **Team Name Input:** Enter the desired names for Team A and Team B in the provided input fields.
2.  **Start Match:** Click the "Start Match" button to initiate the simulation.
3.  **Observe Simulation:** Watch the match unfold in real-time. The score, clock, and statistics will update automatically. Events will be added to the timeline.
4.  **View Result:** Once the match concludes (simulated time reaches 90 minutes), the final result will be displayed, indicating the winning team or a draw.
5.  **Restart Match:** Click the "Restart" button to begin a new match with fresh statistics and a new timeline.  You can change team names at this point.

### Examples

**Example 1: Simulating a Match Between "Home Team" and "Away Team"**

1.  Enter "Home Team" in the Team A input field and "Away Team" in the Team B input field.
2.  Click "Start Match".
3.  Observe the simulation. The statistics and timeline will populate with simulated events.  After 90 simulated minutes, the final result will appear, showing which team won (or a draw).

**Example 2: Restarting a Match After Initial Observation**

1.  After observing a simulated match between two teams, click "Restart."
2.  The match statistics and timeline will be reset, and the simulation will begin anew.

## Code Explanation

### Architecture

The application follows a simple, single-page architecture, typical for simulations of this scale.  The core logic is contained within the `script.js` file, which handles the simulation, updates the UI, and manages the timeline.  The `index.html` file defines the structure and layout of the user interface, and the `style.css` file provides the visual styling, including the green, pitch-themed background. All the simulation logic is handled in the `script.js` file, making the `index.html` file purely for presentation and input.

### Key Components

-   **`script.js` (Simulation Logic):** This file contains the core JavaScript code that drives the match simulation. It manages the match clock, generates random events (goals, cards, etc.), updates the statistics, and renders the events on the timeline. The main loop uses `setInterval` to simulate the passing of time.  We made the decision to keep all logic in this file for ease of deployment and project scope management.

    *   **Example Code Reference (Match Timer):**

    ```javascript
    let matchTime = 0;
    let matchInterval;

    function startMatch() {
      matchInterval = setInterval(() => {
        matchTime++;
        updateMatchTime();
        // ... other simulation logic
      }, 1000); // Update every 1 second (simulated minute)
    }
    ```

-   **`index.html` (User Interface):**  This file defines the structure and layout of the user interface. It includes input fields for team names, display elements for the score, statistics, and timeline, as well as buttons to start and restart the match.  The HTML structure uses semantic elements like `<header>`, `<main>`, and `<footer>` for better accessibility and maintainability.  It uses specific `id` attributes on elements that are targeted by the JavaScript for updates.
    * **Example Code Reference (Statistics Display):**

    ```html
    <div class="statistics">
        <p>Goals A: <span id="goals-a">0</span></p>
        <p>Goals B: <span id="goals-b">0</span></p>
        </div>
    ```
-   **`style.css` (Visual Styling):** This file defines the visual appearance of the application. It includes styles for the overall layout, fonts, colors, and the green, pitch-themed background. The CSS is structured to enhance readability, using comments to organize and label specific sections. Specific selectors target elements based on their `id` and `class` attributes, ensuring proper styling of the game UI.
    * **Example Code Reference (Pitch Background):**

    ```css
    body {
      background-color: #6aa84f; /* Green Pitch Color */
      font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    ```

### Algorithm/Logic

The core of the simulation is based on probabilistic events. Here's a simplified overview:

1.  **Match Clock:** A timer increments every second (representing a minute of the match) using `setInterval`.

2.  **Event Generation:** At each minute, the code generates random numbers to determine if certain events occur:
    *   **Goal:** A higher probability is assigned to goals occurring in standard intervals.
    *   **Shot on Target, Corner, Card:** These events are generated with varying probabilities.

3.  **Statistics Update:**  When an event occurs, the corresponding statistic is incremented and the UI is updated using `document.getElementById` to find and modify the relevant elements.

4.  **Timeline Update:** An event is added to the timeline (a dynamically created list of messages) with the corresponding match time.

5.  **Match End:**  The simulation ends when the match time reaches 90 minutes. The `clearInterval` function is used to stop the `matchInterval`.

6.  **Winner Determination:**  After the simulation ends the code determines the winner based on the scores.  If the scores are equal the match is declared a draw.

    *   **Example Code Reference (Goal Event Logic):**

    ```javascript
    function simulateEvent() {
      if (Math.random() < 0.02) { // 2% chance of a goal
        // Determine which team scored
        const team = Math.random() < 0.5 ? 'a' : 'b';
        if (team === 'a') {
          goalsA++;
          updateScore();
          addTimelineEvent(`${matchTime}' Goal! Team A`);
        } else {
          goalsB++;
          updateScore();
          addTimelineEvent(`${matchTime}' Goal! Team B`);
        }
      }
    }
    ```

### Error Handling

The application uses basic error handling mechanisms.  For instance, input validation is performed to ensure that team names are not empty. While the simulation is primarily client-side, robust error handling is included.

```javascript
//Example Error handling
function validateTeamNames(teamNameA, teamNameB) {
  if (!teamNameA || !teamNameB) {
    alert("Please enter names for both teams.");
    return false;
  }
  return true;
}
```
